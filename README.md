This project is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). It leverages [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling, following the design specifications outlined in the [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/x929imz6B6bpgqY3KecpHM/Candidate-test?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=PJyzMfGDCSUcXttu-0). The application is configured to use Whitelist Domains, the second project on Figma.

I have done some minor design changes in margins and paddings when the numbers doesn't fit the Tailwind spacings. For ex 14px to 16px.

If I had more time, I would fix the accessibility, expand the interactivity and fix the responsiveness.
I would also make a better Button solution since the are multiple different desings for all the different buttons.
